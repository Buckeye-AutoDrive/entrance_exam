## Task 2: 3D Point Cloud Ground Removal

In this task, you'll work with 3D point cloud data (PCD) to remove the ground portion of the point cloud without using neural network-based methods. You can use any suitable modules or algorithms to achieve this.

### Steps to Complete the Task

1. **Set Up Your Environment**
   - Ensure your development environment is ready with Python installed and all necessary libraries for handling 3D point cloud data.

2. **Understand the Provided Base Code**
   - The provided base code will read the point cloud data from a `.bin` file, visualize the raw point cloud, and visualize the filtered point cloud after ground removal. It will also measure and display the inference time for your ground removal algorithm.

3. **Implement Ground Removal**
   - In the provided base code, locate the `ground_removal` function. Implement your ground removal algorithm within this function. Your task is to effectively remove the ground points from the point cloud data.

4. **Visualize the Results**
   - After implementing your algorithm, run the code to visualize both the raw and filtered point clouds. Ensure that the ground has been successfully removed in the filtered visualization.

5. **Measure Inference Time**
   - The base code will automatically measure and display the inference time for your ground removal algorithm. Ensure that your implementation is efficient.

6. **Save and Document Your Results**
   - Document your approach and any important observations. Save any relevant outputs or screenshots that demonstrate your results.

7. **Submit Your Work**
   - Commit your completed work, including your implementation in the `ground_removal` function, documentation, and any saved outputs, to your local repository. Push the changes to your forked repository and create a pull request to submit your work.
