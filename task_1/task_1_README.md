## Task 1: 2D Image Object Detection with YOLO

In this task, you'll focus on 2D image object detection using a neural network. You'll use any version of YOLO (You Only Look Once) to detect objects in five provided sample images. After detecting the objects, you'll need to draw bounding boxes around each detected object and label them with the detected object names.

### Steps to Complete the Task

1. **Set Up Your Environment**
   - Ensure your development environment is ready, with Python installed and all necessary libraries for YOLO.


2. **Clone or Download the YOLO Repository**
   - Choose and set up the version of YOLO you prefer to use, either by cloning the official repository or downloading the required files.


3. **Prepare the Sample Images**
   - Use the five provided sample images in ```sample_images``` for this task. Ensure they are accessible within your YOLO setup.


4. **Run Object Detection**
   - Use the YOLO model to perform object detection on the sample images. Ensure that the model processes all five images.


5. **Implement Your Code**
   - Implement your object detection code in the `2d_detection.py` file provided in the repository. This file is currently empty and should be used to write your solution.


6. **Draw Bounding Boxes and Label Detected Objects**
   - Once detection is complete, draw bounding boxes around the detected objects and label each box with the corresponding object name. Use any appropriate method or tool for this step.


7. **Save and Document Your Results**
   - Save the images with the bounding boxes and labels under ```result``` directory.


8. **Submit Your Work**
   - Commit your completed work, including the processed images, your code in `2d_detection.py`, and your documentation, to your local repository. Push the changes to your forked repository and create a pull request to submit your work.
